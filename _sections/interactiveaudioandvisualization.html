<h3>Cosmic-Echoes</h3>
<h4><strong>An interactive MAX/MSP patch with audiovisual <a href="https://github.com/paranoid2droid/Cosmic-Echoes" target="_blank">[repo]</a></strong></h4>

<p align=left>This is an imagination of throwing some voice, music or whatever you want into the universe, and you get some echo like things. Also, there is a device that detecting the wave form of what you get, displaying the cosmic light somehow colorful... Also, the location of the sound and the waveform you get is related to what you video device is capturing. Through the river of time, those sounds are traveling to you from light-years away. See and hear the echoes from the universe.

<h3>Wild Open Space</h3>
<h4><strong>Game or Synthesizer? <a href="https://github.com/paranoid2droid/WildOpenSpace" target="_blank">[repo]</a></strong></h4>

<p align=left>Use a remote sending OSC messages to the program, playing it and making sounds. The sound engine is written in ChucK. I used several unit generators and STKs built in ChucK for the collision sound with kinds of physics model methods implemented like Karplus-Strong algorithm. A physics engine is also built in for the movements of particles. Parameters of synthesizers are affected by the collision position, including timbre and panning. So have fun in a stereo playback!</p>

<h3>Press Any Key</h3>
<h4><strong>A Keyboard-controlled Step Audio/Video Sequencer Based on MAX/MSP <a href="https://github.com/paranoid2droid/PressAnyKey" target="_blank">[repo]</a></strong></h4>

<p align=left>Control the step sequencer by keyboard. The sample would be immediately triggered when you hit the corresponding Num key, and the delay time of the chord would be modified at the same time. Press any key on your keyboard, and it will trigger a ring modulation with the modulator and carrier set by the ASCII number of the very key. Pressing the "+" and "-" key would change the direction of the sequencer. Plus, It give you a new jazzy chord progression every time the loop starts over!</p>

<h3>Transporting</h3>
<h4><strong>Crossfading between scales and check out Maxolydian! <a href="https://github.com/paranoid2droid/Transporting" target="_blank">[repo]</a></strong></h4>

<p align=left>A slider is set to control the crossfading between two scales which you can set by yourself. You can add any score you like. The new scale I brought up is what I call it "Maxolydian", with a sharp 4th and a flat 7th corresponding to the major scale. The "depth" of this "modulation" can be set by a randomizing parameter. It is clear to feel the difference between modes, scale, and temperament in such way.</p>
