<h3>Cosmic-Echoes</h3>
<h4><strong>An interactive MAX/MSP patch with audiovisual <a href="https://github.com/paranoid2droid/Cosmic-Echoes" target="_blank">[repo]</a></strong></h4>

<p align=left>An interactive synthesizing and audiovisual program. This is an imagination of throwing voice, music or whatever you want into the universe, and you get some echo sounds and lights. The waveform received is displayed with the cosmic colors rendered together on the input images... Also, the panning of the echo sound you get is related to the color-weight of the input images. It feels like those sounds are traveling to you from light-years away through the river of time. See and hear the echoes from the universe.

<h3>Wild Open Space</h3>
<h4><strong>Game or Synthesizer? <a href="https://github.com/paranoid2droid/WildOpenSpace" target="_blank">[repo]</a></strong></h4>

<p align=left>A sonic game using a remote sending OSC messages to the program, playing around while making sounds. The sound engine is written in ChucK. Several unit generators and STKs built in ChucK are used for the collision sounds with various kinds of physics modeling methods implemented like Karplus-Strong algorithm. A physics engine is also built in for the movements of particles. Parameters of synthesizers are affected by the collision position, including timbre and panning. So have fun in a stereo playback!</p>

<h3>Press Any Key</h3>
<h4><strong>A Keyboard-controlled Step Audio/Video Sequencer Based on MAX/MSP <a href="https://github.com/paranoid2droid/PressAnyKey" target="_blank">[repo]</a></strong></h4>

<p align=left>An audio/video sequencer controlled by a QWERTY keyboard. The designated sample would be immediately triggered when you hit the corresponding Num key, and the delay time of the chord would be modified at the same time. Meanwhile, pressing any key on the keyboard will trigger a ring modulation with the modulator and carrier set by the ASCII number of the corresponding key. Pressing the "+" and "-" key would change the direction of the sequencer. Plus, a new set of jazzy chord progression is loaded every time the loop starts over!</p>

<h3>Transporting</h3>
<h4><strong>Crossfading between scales and check out Maxolydian! <a href="https://github.com/paranoid2droid/Transporting" target="_blank">[repo]</a></strong></h4>

<p align=left>A MIDI player with a scale choosing and crossfading feature. A slider is set to control the crossfading between two scales which you can define by yourself. The score to be played is written in MIDI numbers with their corresponding duration. The crossfading can be modified while playing the score, and the "depth" of the "modulation" can be set by a randomizing parameter to create new phrases. I brought up a new scale while developing the patch, which is called "Maxolydian", with a sharp 4th and a flat 7th corresponding to the major scale. It is clear to feel the difference between modes, scale, and temperament in such way.</p>
