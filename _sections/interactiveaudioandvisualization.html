<p align=left>This is an imagination of throwing some voice, music or whatever you want into the universe, and you get some echo like things. Also, there is a device that detecting the wave form of what you get, displaying the cosmic light somehow colorful... Also, the location of the sound and the waveform you get is related to what you video device is capturing. Through the river of time, those sounds are traveling to you from light-years away. See and hear the echoes from the universe.

<p align=left>Use a remote sending OSC messages to the program, playing it and making sounds. The sound engine is written in ChucK. I used several unit generators and STKs built in ChucK for the collision sound with kinds of physics model methods implemented like Karplus-Strong algorithm. A physics engine is also built in for the movements of particles. Parameters of synthesizers are affected by the collision position, including timbre and panning. So it would be more interesting(or more silly) if you use a headphone or stereo speakers.</p>
