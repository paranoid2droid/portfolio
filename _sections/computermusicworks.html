<h6>(for which I call it a "Chulbum")</h6>

<p align=left><code>/* This is an open-source album based on ChucK. It is totally code-generated and you can run the code on your own with the environment required. You will find that every time you "run" a song by the source code, it would be different. Although my Chulbum is just less than 15 minutes, you can make your own a thousand years long. */</code></p>
