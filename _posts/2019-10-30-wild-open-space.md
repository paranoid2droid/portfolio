Use a remote sending OSC messages to the program, playing it and making sounds. The sound engine is written in ChucK. I used several unit generators and STKs built in ChucK for the collision sound with kinds of physics model methods implemented like Karplus-Strong algorithm. A physics engine is also built in for the movements of particles. Parameters of synthesizers are affected by the collision position, including timbre and panning. So have fun in a stereo playback!
