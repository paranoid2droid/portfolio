<h4 align="center">An Open-source Computer Music Album Based on ChucK<strong> <a href="https://github.com/paranoid2droid/whenIAmKingYouWillBeFirstAgainstWall" target="_blank">[repo]</a></strong></h4>
<h6 align="center">(for which I call it a "Chulbum")</h6>

<pre><code>/* This is an open-source album based on ChucK. <br />It is totally code-generated and you can run the code on your own with the environment required. <br />You will find that every time you "run" a song by the source code, it would be different. <br />Although my Chulbum is just less than 15 minutes, you can make your own a thousand years long. */</code></pre>
