An interactive synthesizing and audiovisual program. This is an imagination of throwing voice, music or whatever you want into the universe, and you get some echo sounds and lights. The waveform received is displayed with the cosmic colors rendered together on the input images... Also, the panning of the echo sound you get is related to the color-weight of the input images. It feels like those sounds are traveling to you from light-years away through the river of time. See and hear the echoes from the universe.
