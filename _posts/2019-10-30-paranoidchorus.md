A delay-based audio effect that you can run either as a plug-in or a standalone application. Knobs on the top-left are the basic parameters you can play with in a delay/chorus/flanger effect. In "mood" selection you can control the level of modulating, and in "mode" selection you can choose different oscillators for modulation. Plus, the "mod" slider works as a powerful magic booster for the LFO, generating new awesome sounds by high frequency modulation.
