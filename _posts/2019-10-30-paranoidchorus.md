An effect you can use either as a plug-in or a standalone application. Knobs on the top-left are basically parameters you can modify on a delay/chorus/flanger effect. In "mood" selection you can control the level of modulating, and in "mode" selection you can choose different oscillators. Plus, the "mod" slider works as a powerful magic booster for the LFO, generating awesome sounds from whatever input.
